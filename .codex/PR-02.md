PR-05 — Docs repo(s) / greentic-interfaces docs: Document the “2 functions + macro” pattern

Wherever you document component authoring, update it.

Codex Prompt (paste into the repo that owns component authoring docs; often greentic-interfaces or greentic-component):

PR: Docs — Document component_entrypoint! minimal component pattern

Goal
Update component authoring docs to show the new clean lib.rs.

Tasks

Locate docs that show component boilerplate.

Replace with the minimal macro-based approach.

Mention that the unsafe exports are generated by greentic-interfaces-guest.

Acceptance criteria

No docs encourage writing export glue by hand.

Copy/paste example works.
