# PR-03: Canonical contract tree (single WIT+schema source) + remove copies

## Goal
Establish ONE canonical WIT+schema source tree for 0.6 and remove duplicated WIT trees/snapshots.

## Changes
1) Create canonical tree:
- `wit/greentic/**@0.6.0/**`
- `schemas/cddl/**`
- `contracts/0.6.0/**` (from PR-01)
2) Remove committed `wit/**/deps/**` snapshots in the canonical repo.
3) Downstream repos MUST NOT contain WIT sources for 0.6:
   - they generate bindings from the canonical tree only
4) Add `scripts/wit_lint.sh` in canonical repo:
   - fail on deps snapshots
   - fail on duplicate record definitions across 0.6 packages
   - fail on WIT existing outside the canonical tree (consumer check optional)

## Acceptance criteria
- 0.6 contracts live in exactly one repo/path
- No deps snapshots committed
- wit_lint passes and is wired into CI/local_check
