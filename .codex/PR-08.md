# PR-08: Bindings convergence (host+guest) — no mixed versions

## Goal
Ensure all host/guest bindings are generated from the canonical 0.6 contracts and that older WIT sources are removed from consumers.

## Changes
- Update binding crates to point at canonical contract tree.
- Remove any local WIT copies (0.6 line).
- Add CI checks:
  - only one version of each contract crate in cargo tree
  - fail if consumer repo contains WIT sources for 0.6

## Acceptance criteria
- No linker mismatches due to record field count drift
- cargo tree does not include multiple greentic-interfaces types versions for 0.6 line
