# PR-09: Mechanical port of ALL components/providers to 0.6.0

## Goal
Port the full component/provider set to 0.6.0 with:
- describe() implemented
- CBOR invoke
- capabilities declared
- imports aligned to 0.6 packages

## Approach
- Maintain a manifest list of components/providers considered "in distribution".
- Port in batches but keep a single PR umbrella with a checklist.
- Each port includes:
  - compile to wasm32-wasip2
  - greentic-component test cases
  - schema refs and hashes

## Acceptance criteria
- Every distribution component builds and passes tests
- No component contains WIT sources; all bindings from canonical contracts
- describe() returns deterministic descriptors
