# PR-02: Vocabulary unification (node/component/step) + naming lint

## Goal
Eliminate split-brain naming and enforce one vocabulary going forward.

## Decisions (apply consistently)
- "Component" = executable unit with describe()+invoke()
- "Flow" = graph definition
- "Step" = a flow node instance (avoid "node" in contracts); identifier is `step_id`
- "CallSpec" = what flows store (op + payload_cbor + metadata_cbor)
- "InvocationEnvelope" = host-owned protocol wrapper (ctx + flow_id + step_id + component_id + op + payload_cbor ...)

## Changes
- Update Canonical Map docs if needed.
- Add `scripts/naming_lint.sh` in contract repo and wire into CI:
  - fails on forbidden terms in 0.6 contract tree (e.g. "node-id" if replaced by step-id)
  - fails if call specs include ctx/envelope fields
- Provide "terminology" section in README.

## Acceptance criteria
- naming_lint exists + wired
- 0.6 contracts use the new names consistently
