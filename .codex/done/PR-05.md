# PR-05: Self-describing components (descriptor + capabilities + op schemas)

## Goal
Make every component self-describing and enforceable.

## Contracts
Add/confirm in component world:
- `describe() -> component-descriptor`
Descriptor includes:
- component_id, version
- capabilities (required/provided)
- ops list with input/output schema refs + hashes
- performance hints: max payload, streaming support, caching hints
- i18n hints: supported locales, translation expectations (optional)

## Tooling hooks
- runtime can preflight capabilities and op existence
- schema refs allow conversion and diagnostics

## Acceptance criteria
- describe() types exist in WIT and schema
- capability ids are canonical and reused everywhere
- schema refs have stable hashes and content-type
