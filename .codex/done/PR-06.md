# PR-06: Host/runtime unification for 0.6 (single invocation path)

## Goal
Every runtime path uses the same 0.6 invocation builder:
CallSpec -> (host builds) InvocationEnvelope -> invoke.

## Changes (across runner/operator/test harness)
- Implement CallSpec parsing and envelope construction.
- Remove any code paths that interpret flow/pack JSON as an InvocationEnvelope.
- Cache describe() results and enforce:
  - capability availability
  - op existence
- CBOR is the transport payload; JSON only for authoring conversion.

## Acceptance criteria
- "missing ctx" class of failures eliminated by construction
- describe() is called and used to preflight
- demo run path uses 0.6 invocation builder
