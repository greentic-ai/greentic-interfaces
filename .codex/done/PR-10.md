# PR-10: Legacy adapters + removal of pre-0.6 contract lines

## Goal
End the sandcastle era:
- optionally provide one adapter layer for legacy packs/components
- remove old contract lines from default builds/tooling
- enforce 0.6-only for new work

## Changes
- Adapter (optional):
  - JSON->CBOR conversion and field mapping for legacy invocation
- Deprecation:
  - tooling defaults to 0.6; legacy requires explicit --legacy flag
- CI enforcement:
  - fail new code that targets pre-0.6 WIT packages without explicit legacy marker

## Acceptance criteria
- New workflows use 0.6 only
- Old contracts are not pulled into builds unless legacy mode enabled
- CI blocks drift back to old versions
