# Title: Remove legacy messaging/secrets/events provider protocol WIT worlds + delete legacy events

## Preconditions
- Runner switched to provider-core only (PR-08).
- Provider packs migrated and tests passing (PR-09/10/11).
- Integration tests enforce provider-core only (PR-14).

## Goal
Remove any remaining WIT worlds that encode typed provider protocols for:
- messaging providers/sessions
- events broker/source/sink/bridge
- secrets providers
And delete legacy events worlds entirely.

## Tasks
1. **Delete WIT packages**
   - Remove relevant directories under `wit/greentic/*`
2. **Bindings cleanup**
   - Remove generated binding exports and module references
   - Update `wit_all` re-exports
   - Remove legacy feature flags from host/guest crates
3. **Wasmtime glue cleanup**
   - Update discovery/expectations tests to match new package set
4. **Docs**
   - Update docs to state:
     - provider-core is the only provider protocol
5. **Tests**
   - Ensure default feature compilation passes
   - Ensure no references remain

## Acceptance criteria
- `greentic-interfaces` has:
  - platform base contracts
  - provider-core
  - no domain provider protocol worlds for messaging/secrets/events
- Legacy events removed fully.
